{"article_content": "With five top-ten finishes including a first place win from Chris Ratcliffe PG\u201920, Andover Boys Cross Country defeated St[a][b]. Paul\u2019s in its second dual meet of the season. With a win of 25-30, Andover\u2019s dual meet record now stands at 2-0. \nThis meet featured the biggest group of Andover runners racing this season, according to Head Coach Patrick Rielly.\n\u201cWe had more than 30 compete, many wearing the blue for the first time, and based on the results, we're in a great spot as we look toward the rest of our season,\u201d Rielly wrote in an email to The Phillipian.\nAlthough Andover was missing some of its top finishers, its depth led the team to its victory.\nWilson said, \u201cI think we saw some stiffer competition than we thought we\u2019d see. We were missing some of our top runners too, due to injury and various reasons, so it\u2019s good practice knowing we have a solid squad\u2014that we can have a race even if we\u2019re missing one or two of our top guys.\u201d\nWith a large lineup of new runners for this race, the team bonded significantly during the trip to St. Paul\u2019s, according to Will Sheehy \u201922 and Jack Wilcox \u201922. \n\u201cI think our team came together at this meet because we had a lot of new runners there. On the bus ride back, everyone was talking to each other, so it felt like a complete team,\u201d said Sheehy.\nWilcox said, \u201cWe were all nervous, but also excited. We were all really hyped for each other. After the race, when people PRed or got a good time, everyone would give them pats on the back.\u201d\nDespite Andover\u2019s win, the course proved more challenging than anticipated, according to Harrison Wilson \u201920.\n\u201cI always describe the St. Paul\u2019s course as being quite windy; there are a lot of twists and turns that kind of slow it down even though it\u2019s a relatively flat course. It\u2019s good practice for our Interschols race, just because it has some undulating[c] hills and some wooded sections that require some mental toughness,\u201d said Wilson.\nAccording to Wilson, the team needs to work on pacing the race better, and saving its energy for the last leg of the course.\nWilson said, \u201cNext week, I think we need to strengthen our last mile of the race because we\u2019ve been good at establishing ourselves in our first half of the race\u2026 I think what\u2019s gonna get a lot of teams at Interschols or at bigger meets is our last mile, and if we can really solidify a really strong fast last mile with a strong kick at the end, I think we\u2019ll be able to be a stronger team.\u201d\nThe team will next race the 2018 Nepsac Champion team, Northfield Mount Hermon, during Andover\u2019s Family Weekend for its first home meet of the season. \n \n", "img_path": "nophoto", "headline": "BXC Outruns St. Paul\u2019s During Second Dual Meet of Season", "writer": "Tiffany Tang", "categories": "sports,,featured", "more_options": "--post_date='2019-10-19 16:06:55'"}
