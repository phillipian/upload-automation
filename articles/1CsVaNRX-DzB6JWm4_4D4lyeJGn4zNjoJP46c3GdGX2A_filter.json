{"article_content": "Written in chalk, phrases like \u201cColumbus is a murderer,\u201d and \u201cWhose land are you on?\u201d appeared across campus on the morning of Indigenous People\u2019s Day. Students walking to class saw these messages in front of buildings like Paresky Commons, Morse Hall, and George Washington Hall. \nEmma Slibeck \u201920 and Tomafa Ticeahkie \u201921, Co-Heads of the affinity group Native Americans at Phillips Academy, organized these messages to raise awareness about the celebration of Columbus Day and the fact that Andover is built on the traditional land of the Wabanaki and Naumkeag peoples.\nSlibeck believes that the erasure of indigenous communities from history still permeate modern society. She explained that two of the phrases, \u201cWhose land are you on?\u201d and \u201cKnow their name: Naumkeag and Wabanaki,\u201d aimed to show Andover\u2019s complacency and silence on Indigenous issues.\n\u201cWe [wanted] to really draw attention to whose land [Andover] was built on. [Andover] was built on the unseated land of the Wabanaki and Naumkeag peoples, and I don\u2019t think anybody could tell me that. I couldn\u2019t even tell you that until a week ago or so. I think the \u2018Whose land are you on?\u2019 was the big thing that we had around, because people don\u2019t really think about it,\u201d said Slibeck.\nWhile Slibeck appreciates that the chalk has sparked conversation on campus, she was frustrated by some negative responses. One of the \u201cColumbus is a murderer\u201d messages outside GW was defaced; the word \u201cmurderer\u201d had been anonymously wiped and washed away.\n\u201cSomeone had smudged out the word murderer and poured water on it, which is [definitely] frustrating... It doesn\u2019t take away from what [Columbus] did or the legacy that he left behind, and it was really disheartening to see that on our campus, someone actively smudged it out. That was the most negative response I got,\u201d said Slibeck. \nThe chalk reminded Ariel Wang \u201921 of Dr. Adrienne Keene\u2019s talk, \u201cNative Representations, Pop Culture, & Cultural Resistance in Cyberspace,\u201d which happened on October 10. Wang expressed disappointment that she hadn\u2019t known about the Wabanaki and Naumkeag land before, despite having been an Andover student for three years. \n\u201cThat was the first time I heard someone do a land acknowledgement. [Ticeahkie] and [Slibeck talked about it] before the presentation, and I feel like I should have known about that a long time ago. I should have known whose land I was on a long time before three years after being here, so that was a reminder in a way,\u201d said Wang. \nIn her talk, Keene noted that students play a role in bringing awareness to historical omission. She also emphasized the responsibility that people have in being aware of the history of land in America, as well as the contemporary contributions and representations of Indigenous people.\n\u201cStudents are in classes, learning American history, environmental science, and all different areas of studies. These are areas where indigenous people made contributions, continue to make contributions, where our knowledge is important and matters in those spaces. Students should ask their teachers for more representation of more contemporary native people. Everywhere you walk in is indigenous land. They should think more about these topics and be aware of those topics,\u201d said Keene. \n", "caption": "", "credit": "A..
