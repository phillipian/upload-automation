{"article_content": "Despite sitting out the majority of his Upper year due to a shoulder injury, Connor Ding \u201920 was voted Andover Boys Soccer Co-Captain at the end of last season. According to Head Coach Edwin Escobar, Ding\u2019s energy and drive were evident even when he wasn\u2019t able to play.\n\u201cEvery single day [last year], Connor would come and he would continue to train even though he was limited. While he may not have been able to play soccer, he would continue to run laps around the track, continue to check on the team to see how things are going,\u201d said Escobar. \nAccording to Ding, he strives to make a good impression on his teammates by putting consistent effort into his play.\n\u201cI try to lead by example,\u201d said Ding. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to know how to motivate each player individually, but by working hard each day, other players tend to feed off of that energy.\u201d\nAs Co-Captain, Ding leads the team through his actions and attention to detail, according to teammate Ethan Hong \u201922 and fellow Co-Captain David Wang \u201920.\n\u201cHe leads by doing what needs to be done,\u201d said Hong. \u201cHe lets his actions do the talking by doing the little things right. He is a vocal leader on the team, but people don\u2019t give him nearly as much credit for what he actually accomplishes on the team.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good model to follow. He\u2019s a good student and he leads by example. He\u2019s reserved but he does most of his [work] without saying anything,\u201d added Wang.\nAs a Senior on the team, Ding has helped the team succeed through the way in which he exemplifies the ideal student-athlete, according to Escobar.\nEscobar said, \u201cI think that [Ding] has shown to be a student-athlete that can balance things really well. I think he\u2019s an exceptional student and he plays soccer at an exceptional level. And to be able to do both things is something that young student-athletes look at and see it as a reference ... if you\u2019re looking at Connor Ding, you\u2019re looking at a complete student-athlete.\u201d\nAccording to Hong, Ding prioritizes inclusivity and communication to create a tight bond.\nHong said, \u201cI think he helps by reaching out to players who aren\u2019t really as close with the rest of the team. We are trying to establish a family on this team, and I think Ding is a great example of how we want to act by welcoming new guys.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty easy guy to talk to. I think he knows how important communication is, and that\u2019s what makes him a great leader,\u201d added Escobar.\nAs center back, Ding combines a high level of skill with composure to lead on the field, according to Escobar.\nEscobar said, \u201cI think what Connor brings to the team is a level of calmness. When he has the ball, everybody feels comfortable that what he\u2019s going to do with it is going to be something positive. So I think he brings a great level of positivity to the team and because of that, everybody takes the field with a lot more confidence.\u201d\nAccording to Ding, he works to create both a fun and competitive environment at practice.\n\u201cI try to be a vocal leader on the field, but off the field I\u2019m pretty laid back and like to have fun with my teammates,\u201d said Ding. \u201cI work hard every day in practice, but I also want to make practices fun. I think a healthy amount of competition at practice each day is good for a team.\u201d\nAccording to Escobar, Ding sets his priorities straight and has an innate ability for leading.\n\u201cHe knows very well that what he does off the field is equally as important as what he does on the field. He leads by example, on and off the field,\u201d said Escobar. \u201cHe lets all of his work do the talking and he\u2019s been a consistent leader throughout the time that he\u2019s been here with us.\u201d\n", "caption": "Co-Captain Connor Ding \u201920 won the Mass US Club State Cup last May.", "credit": "B..MCKEE/The Phillipian", "img_path": "/home/plipdigital/wp-photos/10-18/sports/connor/connording.bmckee.JPG", "headline": "Co-Captain Connor Ding \u201920 is a \u201cComplete Student-Athlete\u201d", "writer": "Luke Boshar", "categories": "sports,", "more_options": ""}
