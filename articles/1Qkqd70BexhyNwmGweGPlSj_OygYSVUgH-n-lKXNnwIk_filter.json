{"article_content": "Andover Girls Cross Country\u2019s fastest racer for the second week in a row, Natasha Muromcew \u201922, crossed the finish line with a time of 20:41 minutes, contributing to Andover\u2019s 16-46 win over St. Paul\u2019s this past Saturday.\nCompleting a first through fourth place sweep behind Muromcew were teammates Izzy Alvarez-Martinez \u201923 with a time of 20:57 minutes, Tiffany Tang \u201922 with a time of 21 minutes and 8 seconds, and Tessa Conrardy \u201920 with a time of 21 minutes and 24 seconds. According to Ava Sullivan \u201923, the flatter St. Paul\u2019s course presented a new challenge to the team.\nIn an email to The Phillipian, Sullivan wrote, \u201cA key takeaway from this meet is adjusting to the change of speed when it comes to a flat coarse like this one. During the races we have had this season, there have been at least two significant uphills which require a slight pace change, but also some long and steep downhills which help with speeding up. At St. Paul\u2019s, the course didn\u2019t have much of this change in elevation, which called for a different type of racing strategy and pace compared to what I had been used to.\u201d\nThe team focused on using pack running to its benefit, helping to motivate each other throughout the race, according to Muromcew.\n\u201cSomething notable is that our first five girls had an average time of 21 [minutes and 9 seconds] and we were all within one minute of each other\u2026One thing that helped [the team] is our pack running. We\u2019ve really hit a spot in which we can all race together or near each other, and that helps us push ourselves and each other further than we might expect,\u201d wrote Muromcew in an email to The Phillipian.\nAlthough the team lost five of its top runners from last year, it has bounced back this season with the help of newer runners, according to Muromcew.\nMuromcew continued, \u201cI think that we\u2019ve had a little bit of a rough start since we lost our top five runners from last year, but we\u2019ve recovered with the help of some of the new runners. Some runners in specific would be Tiffany Tang, Izzy Alvarez-Martinez, Maya Tang [\u201923], and Ava Sullivan. They\u2019ve been performing so well this season, and I think that they also show a lot of promise for a strong team in years forwards.\u201d \nIn preparation for its first home meet of the season, the team will study and train on the Andover course during practice, according to Kate Pfister \u201921.\n\n\n\u201cSince our next race is home, we\u2019ll probably spend a lot of this week focusing on our own course and how to run it. Our team in general made a breakthrough this week with some of our fastest times of the season, and we had some injured runners getting back into racing again which was great,\u201d wrote Pfister in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe team will race Northfield Mount Hermon at home this Saturday.\nEditor\u2019s Note: Tessa Conrardy is President of The Phillipian.\n", "img_path": "nophoto", "headline": "", "writer": "Justin Hardy", "categories": "sports,", "more_options": ""}
