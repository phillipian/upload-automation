{"article_content": "With a squash racket in hand, Charlotte Whitehurst \u201922 strummed her fingers against her makeshift guitar to the beat of \u201cLove Story\u201d by Taylor Swift as Ash Cohan \u201920 held a microphone. Throughout their performance, Whitehurst and Cohan lip-synced lyrics of the song. When Swift sang \u201cmarry me Juliet,\u201d Whitehurst got down on one knee and acted out a marriage proposal as the audience cheered and laughed. \nThis past Saturday evening, Open Mic Night Meets Lip Sync Battle was held in Susie\u2019s, with acts ranging from spontaneous lip-syncing to a prepared piano solo. Audience member Nick Gibeley \u201922 said, \u201cI absolutely loved [Whitehurst and Cohan\u2019s] performance. \u201cLove Story\u201d is such a great throwback song to our childhoods, and I also loved how Charlotte used the racket as a guitar as it brought both a carefree and lighthearted mood to the evening.\u201d\nThe two emcees, Lilly Feeney \u201920 and Hywot Ayana \u201920, shuffled around Susie\u2019s, encouraging students to perform impromptu and announcing participants. Ayana, alongside partner Chioma Ugwonali \u201920, was the first to take the stage, lip syncing to \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d by Lizzo.\nAyana said, \u201cI chose to participate because I wanted to get other people involved. Getting up on stage and performing in front of your peers can be hard, so I wanted to go first to at least break that ice. I'm not good at singing or dancing, but I wanted to help make other people feel more comfortable getting on stage.\u201d\nThe second act of the night, featuring Amelia Meyer \u201921 and her prefectees Zadie Rutty-Turner \u201923 and Aleena Kibria \u201923, took to the stage wearing colorful sunglasses as Meyer moonwalked across the stage while lip syncing to \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d by Mariah Carey.\nMeyer said, \u201cOur dorm, Draper [Cottage], had a collective dorm performance tonight. Every single night, we end up screaming and dancing, and \u201cAll I Want For Christmas\u201d is one of our favorites. Tonight\u2019s [lip syncing battle was] a great way to show dorm spirit and de-stress. Dance and music are so powerful and there\u2019s a lot of humor with it.\u201d\nEmma Jing \u201922 and Emily Smith \u201922 lip-synced to \u201cBreaking Free\u201d from High School Musical. While dancing around the stage, the audience turned their phone flashlights on and waved them back and forth. According to Jing, their song choice was spontaneous and fun.\n\u201cWe chose [\u2018Breaking Free\u2019] as a throwback to our childhoods. We all watched \u2018High School Musical\u2019 when we were younger, so we wanted a song we both knew and that the crowd could sing along to and enjoy,\u201d said Jing. \u201cBe brave and go up there, because no one\u2019s going to make fun of your performance, so you should enjoy yourself a little and bring a friend if you feel really nervous.\u201d \n", "caption": "Amelia Meyer \u201921, Zadie Rutty-Turner \u201923, and Aleena Kibria \u201923 (From left to right) captured the stage by lip syncing to \u201cAll I Want for Christmas.\u201d", "credit": "D.
