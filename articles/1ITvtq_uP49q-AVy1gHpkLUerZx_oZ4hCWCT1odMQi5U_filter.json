{"article_content": "\n\nAfter five years as the director of the Addison Gallery of American Art, Judith Dolkart will be leaving her position this December to become deputy director at the Detroit Institute of Arts in January. As director at the Addison, Dolkart was responsible for all the operations and curation duties. In her new position, she will be working as a curator as well as creating educational resources.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be responsible for the curatorial side of house, as well as education and programming, so working with the curators on their collections, exhibition ideas and ideas for acquisitions\u2026Then for education, they have a very robust educational department that serves children and adults from three counties all around Detroit. Programming will be things that complement whatever the exhibitions are\u2026 This could be a wide variety of activities for children and adults,\u201d said Dolkart. \nOne of the reasons that Dolkart has decided to take the new job is the vast amount of resources that will be at her disposal working for an institution such as the Detroit Institute of Arts. From the diverse art collection to the wide range of departments, Dolkart believes she will have more opportunities to explore work in her field.\n\u201cDetroit has one of the best collections in the United States. It\u2019s an absolute killer, and it\u2019s encyclopedic, so it has many different kinds of departments. It has European paintings, American paintings, African art, Asian, Islamic art, so lots of different aspects\u2026 It\u2019ll be fun to look at other cultures, and other styles and ideas and artists,\u201d said Dolkart.\nDolkart expects her experience in curatorial direction at the Addison to be valuable in her new role. One of her hopes for her new job is to share the wonder in the discovery of art, which she experienced in her cultivation of the Addison collections. \n\u201cI love the moment of discovery when students come into the museum learning center and they see something for the first time, or they make a discovery for themselves about something that they\u2019re looking at. It\u2019s something they see in the object themselves, and you can\u2019t beat that,\u201d said Dolkart.\nWorking in museums has been Dolkart\u2019s long-time passion. Even though some may consider curating a less accessible or normalized occupation, Dolkart\u2019s family history and educational path led her down the road of museum work.\n\u201cI had a grandmother who worked at a museum when I was growing up, so I got to see the behind the scenes, which made the museum more magical to me. And, I went to [Phillips Exeter Academy]. When I was there, I went on a school year abroad and I went to France, and we were required to take art history, which was not in any way a burden. We would study things in the classroom and then we would go to see them around France\u2026and to me that became so exciting. You\u2019d study this thing, and then you went and saw it\u2026 and that\u2019s when I decided that that\u2019s what I wanted to study in college, art history. And then I became a specialist in French Art,\u201d said Dolkart.\nAside from Andover and its students, Dolkart will miss her colleagues at the Addison. \n\u201cThey are not only the best at what they do, and that\u2019s a professional distinction, but they\u2019re also great people. They\u2019re smart, and they\u2019re funny and they\u2019re a pleasure to be with every day\u2026they\u2019re creative, they\u2019re thoughtful, committed professionals,\u201d she said. \n", "caption": "Judith Dolkart began her tenure at the Addison Gallery of American Art in July of 2014.", "credit": "COURTESY OF SUSAN BEARD", "img_path": "/home/plipdigital/wp-photos/10-18/arts/judith/judith.courtesyofsusanbeard.JPG", "headline": "Director of the Addison Gallery Judith Dolkart Accepts Position at the Detroit Institute of Arts", "writer": "Aleisha Roberts", "categories": "arts", "more_options": ""}
