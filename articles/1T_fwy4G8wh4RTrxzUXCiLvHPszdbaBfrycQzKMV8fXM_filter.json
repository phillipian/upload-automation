{"article_content": "Tipping in a shot from Captain Carly Kreytak \u201920, Anna Bargman \u201921 scored Andover Field Hockey\u2019s first and only goal against St. Paul\u2019s. Bargman\u2019s goal in the second half drove Andover to a 1-0 win last Saturday.\nAccording to Kreytak and Head Coach Kate Dolan, although the game was low-scoring, Andover was able to control the flow of the game in both halves.\nKreytak said, \u201cI think that we did a good job keeping them in their zone. We were very close to scoring so many times\u2026 I think that it was a challenging game overall.\u201d\nCoach Dolan added in an email to The Phillipian, \u201cWe dominated in terms of possession in our offensive half of the field.\u201d\nEven though the team maintained a four-game winning streak, the team still believes it has room for improvement, according to Kreytak.\nKreytak said, \u201cI think we have a lot more potential. Actually, our game last Tuesday against Milton Academy was really good, it was a good showing of how hard we are able to work and how much we want to win\u2026 But at St. Paul\u2019s, I think that it was almost like a lull in our season, because even though we won, we definitely could have beaten them by a lot more. We just need to focus on being intentional in what we are doing and being hungrier to win.\u201d\n\u201cWe can continue to improve, particularly with our communication, our ability to finish plays within our offensive 25, and passing the ball with greater consistency and strength,\u201d added Dolan.\nAndover also visited Middlesex on Wednesday for a 1-0 loss, putting its current record at 8-2. According to Kiera Suh \u201922, despite the close score, the team wasn\u2019t able to make the necessary plays.\n\u201cAfter this game, we\u2019re realizing the importance of finishing, as well as the importance of playing as a team. Our midfield set up many crisp plays or passes into the circle that we weren\u2019t quite able to put away. We also started to get quiet at the end of the first half which created a bit of confusion and discombobulation across the field,\u201d said Suh. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to get our team chemistry right in order to define this year\u2019s team. There\u2019s a lot of small controllable things that we still aren\u2019t doing consistently such as calling people off the ball or running hard into loose balls.\u201d\nAndover looks to regain its winning streak against Northfield Mount Hermon at home this Saturday.\n", "caption": "Rachel Neyman \u201922 is a midfielder for Andover Field Hockey", "credit": "D.
